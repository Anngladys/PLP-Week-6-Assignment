## 🤖 Part 2: Practical Implementation

### ✅ Task 1: Edge AI Prototype
- Built an image classification model (e.g., for recyclable items).
- Converted to TensorFlow Lite and simulated deployment.
- Discussed real-time inference benefits and latency reduction.

### ✅ Task 2: AI-Driven IoT Concept
- Designed a *Smart Agriculture System* using:
  - Sensors: Soil moisture, temperature, light.
  - AI Model: Predict crop yield.
  - *Deliverables:* Data flow diagram + 1-page proposal.

### ✅ Task 3: Ethics in Personalized Medicine
- Used insights from TCGA dataset.
- Analyzed bias risks (e.g., underrepresented ethnic groups).
- Proposed fairness strategies: re-weighting, representative sampling.
